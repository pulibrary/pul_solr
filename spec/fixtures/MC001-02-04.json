          "The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was established in 1920 to protect the\n                specific constitutional freedoms in the Bill of Rights. In 1915 the American Union\n                Against Militarism (AUAM) was formed to prevent United States involvement in World\n                War I with Crystal Eastman serving as executive secretary. Roger Baldwin became\n                executive director in 1917. Immediately upon United States entry in World War I, the\n                AUAM was inundated with requests for aid to protect free speech, assembly and press\n                which were threatened with political restriction imposed upon U.S. entry into the\n                war and to defend the rights of conscientious objectors. A separate organization was\n                needed to safeguard these rights, and thus the National Civil Liberties Bureau\n                (NCLB) was established in the autumn of 1917 with Roger Baldwin as director.",
          "For the history of the ACLU during the Baldwin years, see the history in the ACLU\n                finding aid, 1912-1950.",
          "The ACLU, 1950-1995: The Trials of Growth",
          "The forty years between 1950 and 1990 were a time of significant growth for the\n                American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Membership increased twenty-five times, and\n                the Union's impact on the legal landscape was broad and deep. One historian decreed\n                that the decade after 1954 witnessed \"the greatest advances in civil liberties in\n                American history,\" with significant gains for African-Americans, women, students,\n                the mentally-ill, prisoners, and others previously denied the full protection\n                afforded by the U.S. Constitution. This period also saw the end to much censorship\n                and the decoupling of church/state activity. The ACLU's boom was not without the\n                threat of bust, however. The organization restructured itself several times as it\n                wrestled to reflect internally the principles it espoused publicly. Its expansion\n                into new areas of civil rights along with its firm stand on the First Amendment\n                produced episodes that threatened the ACLU's viability.",
          "Organizational Expansion",
          "In the years immediately following World War II, younger, non-founding members of the\n                ACLU Board pressed for and eventually achieved a structural reorganization that led\n                to the Union's present configuration. In 1950, Roger Baldwin's role changed from\n                administrator to ambassador, in which he toured, lectured, and wrote on civil\n                liberties issues. While at the helm of the ACLU, Baldwin preferred that the ACLU\n                remain a small, centrally-controlled unit with himself at the helm, something that\n                changed under the administration of his successor, Patrick Murphy Malin. A\n                Swarthmore economist, Malin lacked Baldwin's charm and speaking skills, but he was a\n                successful administrator who oversaw the growth of the organization from 9,000\n                members in 1950 to over 60,000 by the time of his departure in 1962.",
          "Much of this growth can be attributed to the expansion of local affiliates at the\n                state and regional level that had their own boards and acted upon local civil\n                liberties issues. Many served as watchdogs--ensuring that civil rights victories won\n                by the national ACLU in the high courts were enforced at the local level--while\n                other affiliates were active in initiating cases, often with more absolutist\n                positions than the national office. Though the affiliates had a voice in deciding\n                the national chapter's direction and policy since 1954, the organizational mechanism\n                by which this was accomplished was cumbersome, changing several times. A workable\n                method was found in 1967 with the creation of an 80-member board of directors\n                comprised of representatives from all the affiliates and thirty at-large members. In\n                addition, starting in 1959 and continuing to the present, the ACLU held biennial\n                conferences to inform membership on pertinent topics, and to gather their views on\n                civil liberties issues.",
          "The Cold War and Civil Liberties",
          "Historian Samuel Walker divides the ACLU's area of activity between 1950-1990 into\n                four broad areas: Cold War issues, censorship, church/state, and civil rights. The\n                beginning of the Cold War, the rise of Joseph McCarthy and the re-emergence of the\n                House Committee on Un- American Activities (HUAC) created an atmosphere of\n                intolerance and suspicion that not only posed a threat to individual civil\n                liberties, but also destroyed the lives of many caught in the web spun by the\n                Wisconsin Senator and his minions. The ACLU challenged the actions of McCarthy and\n                HUAC on the tenet that only peoples' acts, not their beliefs, should be penalized;\n                anything less infringed on First Amendment principle.",
          "While the ACLU had not always lived up to these same principles (in 1940 it ousted\n                board member Elizabeth Gurley Flynn for her membership in the Communist Party), by\n                the early 1950s the ACLU did not hesitate to aid in the publication of Merle\n                Miller's  The Judges and the Judged . The book detailed\n                HUAC's and McCarthy's red-baiting tactics, such as the prevalent use of unnamed (and\n                hence unreliable or unanswerable) sources, guilt by association or exercise of one's\n                Fifth Amendment rights, and other questionable means that resulted in blacklistings\n                and firings of many in unions, the film industry, and the teaching profession. The\n                ACLU called for the abolition of HUAC, attacked any measure that punished Communist\n                Party members or denied them rights based solely on party membership (  Kent v. Dulles , for example), and sought fair and open\n                investigations for the accused. In testament to its strict adherence to principle,\n                the ACLU reminded the United States Senate of its obligation to provide McCarthy a\n                fair hearing when it began censure proceedings against him in 1954.",
          "The ACLU may have stood up for the rights of the accused more readily in 1950 than it\n                did in 1940 because Roger Baldwin had developed a  quid pro\n                    quo  with J. Edgar Hoover in which the ACLU did not publicize FBI civil\n                rights violations, and high-level Union officers cooperated with the Bureau. Baldwin\n                and others thought that this cooperation, in conjunction with the Flynn resolution,\n                inoculated the Union against attack as a Communist-front organization, freeing it to\n                spend its energies defending constitutional principle, not itself. This arrangement,\n                shocking when revealed in later years, did not prevent the FBI from continuing its\n                massive surveillance of the ACLU and its members.",
          "Red hunters cited national security as the basis for their actions, a justification\n                that the government would continue to invoke and one that the ACLU contested in such\n                cases as the Pentagon Papers (  U.S. v. New York Times ),\n                Watergate (  U.S. v. Nixon ), and Iran-Contra. In 1969,\n                13 years after Joseph McCarthy's death, the ACLU's vigilance bore the ultimate fruit\n                in  Brandenburg v. Ohio  in which the Supreme Court ruled\n                that the government only could punish direct incitement to lawless action, thereby\n                invalidating the Smith Act and all state sedition laws that restricted radical\n                political thought.",
          "Censorship and Freedom of Speech",
          "The cousin to McCarthyism's national security cause was the drive to protect people\n                from printed materials and movies that promoted Communism or were perceived to erode\n                community morals. Censorship attempts were, from the ACLU's point of view, a\n                fundamental attack on free speech, and over the course of three decades, the Union\n                came to adopt an absolutist position, suffering no infringement in any form.\n                Beginning with a 1952 Supreme Court victory in  Burstyn v.\n                    Wilson/McCaffrey  in which the high court declared that states cannot\n                prohibit the screening of films based on state-based standards, the ACLU rang up a\n                string of court victories. These, combined with changing market pressures, brought a\n                complete end to many common censorship practices by the 1960s (  Jacobellis v. Ohio ), including the sharp curtailment of\n                post office censorship (  Hannegan v. Esquire ).",
          "In a related decision, the Supreme Court gave a boost to freedom of the press in\n                     New York Times v. Sullivan  which declared that\n                public officials could not sue for defamation unless they proved \"actual malice,\"\n                thereby providing the media with heretofore unknown freedom to report critically.\n                Freedom of speech was extended, with the ACLU's assistance, by placing it above\n                property rights in  Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins ,\n                with the high court deciding that a shopping center could not forbid the\n                distribution of political pamphlets on its premises.",
          "Perhaps the most famous free speech issue of the ACLU's history, and certainly one\n                that had the greatest impact on the organization, was the pitched battle over\n                American Nazis' right to parade through Skokie, Illinois in 1977. Half the town's\n                70,000 citizens were Jewish, and about 1,000 were Holocaust survivors, but this did\n                not dissuade the ACLU (then headed by Aryeh Neier who was Jewish) from taking on the\n                Nazis' cause in what the ACLU considered a \"classic First Amendment case.\"",
          "What the Union did not count on was a vigorous counter-argument by the Jewish Defense\n                League, nor the loss of the support of its long-time ally, the American Jewish\n                Congress. The ACLU won the court case, though the Nazis never marched in Skokie\n                (ultimately parading at a site in downtown Chicago), but the highly-publicized case\n                caused a backlash resulting in a large drop in membership. Neier, who had assumed\n                the executive director's post after the departure of John de J. Pemberton in 1970\n                and was accustomed to growing membership rolls and increasing budgets, found himself\n                unable to reconcile the organization's activities with available funds and resigned.\n                His successor, Ira Glasser, initiated an emergency appeal to supporters and raised\n                over $500,000, allowing him to re-structure organizationally and financially,\n                placing the ACLU back in the black and ready for the looming trials of the Reagan\n                Revolution.",
          "Church/State",
          "The ACLU earned the enmity of many for its efforts in enforcing the separation of\n                church and state. Working to end state-sanctioned forms of religion, predominantly\n                mainstream Protestantism, the ACLU sought to abolish school prayer, various\n                government subsidies for religious education, and other connections between\n                government and religious activity. Starting in 1947 with  Everson v. Board of Education , the court delineated the Establishment\n                Clause and the ACLU began to challenge long-entrenched government support for\n                religious activity. Assailing school prayer, the ACLU won high court decisions to\n                end it (  Engel v. Vitale  and  Abington School District v. Schempp ). It also re-fought the Scopes trial\n                (  Epperson v. Arkansas ) in Arkansas which had required\n                the teaching of creationism as well as evolution.",
          "Frequently working in conjunction with Protestants United for the Separation of\n                Church and State (later Americans United...) and the American Jewish Congress, the\n                ACLU repeatedly clashed with the desires of the Roman Catholic Church on issues such\n                as censorship, birth control, or school aid, often with the ACLU the victor. By the\n                late 1960s, changes in public attitude toward church/state issues cemented the\n                organization's gains, as many mainstream churches accepted the delineation. However,\n                fundamentalist religions continued challenging laws on public prayer issues into the\n                1990s, with little effect (  Wallace v. Jaffree ). Often,\n                the affiliates bore the brunt of enforcement on church/state separation, acting to\n                check sometimes frequent local infringements, thus proving Roger Baldwin's assertion\n                that \"no victory ever stays won.\"",
          "Civil Rights",
          "The First Amendment clearly delineates free speech protection and church/state\n                separation, and it was easy for the ACLU to pick up the banner for these causes.\n                However, most of the ACLU's work from the 1950s onward involved the more ambiguous\n                and complex realm of civil rights, helping secure the rights or expanding the\n                concept of those same rights for those who had been denied them in the past such as\n                African-Americans, women, homosexuals, children, the mentally-ill, prisoners, and\n                the accused. In this multifaceted arena, the ACLU found itself embroiled both\n                internally and externally, as the national organization sought to define its mission\n                even as state affiliates and regional offices acted on their own accord, usually\n                pushing further and harder than the national organization planned to go.",
          "For example, during the Vietnam War ACLU moderates clashed with anti-war activists\n                over the issue of representing Dr. Benjamin Spock, the famous pediatrician and\n                prominent anti-war activist accused of interfering with the functions of government\n                when he organized a \"Stop the Draft\" Week in 1968. Legal director Melvin Wulf first\n                announced that the ACLU would represent Spock, only to be overruled by the national\n                board, prompting the Massachusetts affiliate to take up Spock's cause. Though\n                ultimately the government would drop its case, pro- Spock members saw the case as an\n                opportunity to raise questions about the Vietnam War's legitimacy (as well as\n                freedom of speech), while moderates viewed that issue as outside the ACLU's scope.\n                It also brought to the fore a long-simmering debate over whether the ACLU should\n                participate directly in lawsuits or contribute  amicus\n                    curiae  (\"friend of the court\") briefs to other cases. After reviewing its\n                most recent past activity, the Union decided that they had de facto become directly\n                involved in cases and would continue as such.",
          "Despite the organizational turmoil, a discussion of the ACLU's legal success under\n                the civil rights rubric threatens to become a numbing list of historic Supreme Court\n                decisions.  Brown v. Board of Education , which\n                overturned  Plessy v. Ferguson  and tolled the end of\n                government-endorsed segregation was one of many cases in which the ACLU worked\n                together with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)\n                to win rights for African-Americans. The ACLU participated in all the major civil\n                rights cases, arguing for freedom of speech and association rights that allowed the\n                sit-ins, freedom rides, and other methods employed by the movement.",
          "Other famous high court cases in which the ACLU partook include:  Griswold v. Connecticut , which recognized a right to\n                privacy, thereby laying the foundation for future abortion rights decisions;  Tinker v. Des Moines  and  In re\n                    Gault , two cases recognizing that minors enjoyed some Constitutional\n                protection, especially in regard to freedom of speech and due process; and  Miranda v. Arizona ,  Mapp v.\n                    Ohio ,  Escobedo v. Illinois , and  Gideon v. Wainwright , all of which expanded the rights of\n                the accused, mandating an explanation of their rights and access to counsel, and\n                placing limits on police action. (While these last cases caused many police groups\n                to view the ACLU with hostility, the Union also defended a police officer's right to\n                belong to conservative political organizations such as the John Birch Society.)",
          "As the concept of civil rights expanded, the ACLU started several special projects\n                designed to focus solely on specific topics, including the Mental Health Law\n                Project, the Project on Amnesty, the Privacy Project, the Women's Rights Project,\n                the Lesbian and Gay Rights Project, and Prisoners' Rights Project. Each project\n                worked not only to change the law, but to educate the public and raise their own\n                funds.",
          "Expansion Issues",
          "The Children's Rights Project is an example of how the ACLU changed itself from a\n                small, centrally-controlled organization to an expansive confederacy of groups\n                working to advance the goal of civil liberties. With its roots in the 1970s and\n                located at the national organization's office in New York City, it was one of the\n                focused projects financially seeded by the national organization. In 1995, it had\n                become successful enough to incorporate itself and separate from the ACLU\n                organizationally, physically, and financially. Another sign of growth was the start\n                of the regional offices. In addition to the Washington, D.C. office (established\n                1938) the Southern Regional Office in Atlanta was organized in 1964 and the Mountain\n                States Regional Office in Denver a few years later. Each handled cases particular to\n                their geographic areas, as well as the usual range of cases that interested the\n                ACLU. This led to varying interpretations of ACLU policy which resulted in the\n                creation of the ACLU's official policy guides, issued first in 1966 and revised\n                periodically. These represented the ACLU's attempt to coordinate and control the\n                types of cases the Union would take on and to shepherd resources along coordinated\n                lines.",
          "Unfortunately, the national organization had trouble determining what path to take,\n                as many individuals within the organization pulled in different directions.\n                Exacerbating this problem was the ACLU's re-structuring which attempted to reconcile\n                the many voices in the civil liberties debate. After the first re-organization which\n                opened up policy making to affiliates in 1954, the ACLU re-organized again in 1964,\n                establishing a two-tiered system of governance in which affiliate representatives\n                met twice a year and the board of directors in between. The dichotomy did not\n                provide any stability and three years later, the Union re-organized once again,\n                establishing its one-body 80-member board. Throughout this time, the ACLU continued\n                its board committees--some standing, others ad hoc--which focused on particular\n                issues such as academic freedom or due process. In later years, the rise of the\n                special projects would overtake some of the committees' work and the role of the\n                committees would be reduced, though not eliminated.",
          "The establishment of the Roger N. Baldwin/ACLU Foundation in 1967 was another major\n                organizational change for the ACLU. The Union created the charitable fund-raising\n                arm to pay attorneys to work on the ACLU's behalf, signalling the end of the\n                national organization's long- standing reliance on volunteer lawyers. Though\n                volunteer attorneys continued to play a significant role in many of the affiliates,\n                even there some groups, such as the New York and Southern California affiliates, had\n                a history of paying for legal representation. The Foundation's purpose was to\n                solicit funds from, among other places, other foundations, and during its early\n                years much of its resources supported civil rights work in the South. In later\n                years, it would provide initial funds for many of the special projects, gather any\n                legal fees won by the project lawyers, applying the funds against the project's\n                overhead costs.",
          "These changes reflected not only the organization's growth, but also its expanding\n                interpretation of what constituted civil liberties work. Starting with the civil\n                rights movement and continuing on through the Vietnam War and Watergate, the ACLU\n                fought internally, often bitterly, over the scope and nature of its work. In this\n                battle, the broad interpreters of the Union's mission won out, as the organization\n                took on cases involving abortion rights, women's rights, affirmative action, and\n                other areas, far from the basic principle of protecting First Amendment rights on\n                which the Union was founded.",
          "The 1980s and early 1990s",
          "The ACLU emerged from the 1970s a victor of many legal battles and organizationally\n                strong. However, despite its track record and strength, the ACLU would not ring up a\n                string of Supreme Court victories in the 1980s and 1990s as it had in the previous\n                two decades. Public sentiment, long an ally in many areas, had shifted against the\n                organization, to the point that ACLU membership was identified as\n                out-of-the-mainstream. In the 1988 presidential election, GOP candidate George Bush,\n                willfully unaware of nearly fifty years of Supreme Court decisions, echoed the\n                phrase of Joseph McCarthy in calling his opponent, Michael Dukakis, a \"card-\n                carrying member of the ACLU\" for his opposition to a flag-salute requirement. The\n                Bush accusation reflected the state of public awareness of civil liberties in the\n                1980s as the ACLU re- fought a number of battles over such issues as censorship,\n                school prayer, creationism, and abortion rights. In the area of censorship, the\n                Union withstood challenges from both right and left, the latter trying to censor\n                publications under the rubric of protecting women. However, the ACLU stood firm in\n                its belief in the absolute freedom of speech.",
          "The U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights were written to guarantee that the\n                rights of the minority would not be infringed upon by the majority; the ACLU's\n                accomplishments during the twentieth century helped to ensure that unpopular views\n                would be tolerated, and indirectly, to remind people that it is an uncommon nation\n                that commonly tolerates challenges to the majority view.",
